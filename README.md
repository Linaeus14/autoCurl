A one-at-a-time curl response invoker to Excel report from a list of links

## How to use

1. Ensure you have bash or other Unix/Linux terminal, if not google one and install it e.g. git bash for Windows.
2. Make your way to the parent dir of the autoCurl folder e.g cd /path/autoCurl/ or cd C:/path/autoCurl on Windows
3. Type sudo ./auto.sh or just ./auto.sh on windows and press enter to run it. Easy right? (give permission first to run if on Unix OS, google it)
